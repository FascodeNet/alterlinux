## Vulnerabilities and issues of each package

Arch Linux, the source of Alter Linux, is a rolling release.
Therefore, all packages except some original packages depend on the Arch community and each package maintainer.
SereneTeam recommends that you always keep your packages up to date.
Please report bugs and vulnerabilities according to [Arch's bug reporting guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bug_reporting_guidelines).


## Alter's own bugs and vulnerabilities
If you find a bug or vulnerability and it is an Alter-specific issue, post it to the Alter Linux Issue.
In this case, please follow the arch bug report guidelines and inform the developer of the problem and environment in detail.
As long as developers adhere to the minimum courtesy and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), no further courtesy is required. Tell the developer in detail what you have done, your environment and the version.
