# GRUB 2 binary names and boot directory
# Some distributions (e.g. Fedora) use grub2-* (resp. /boot/grub2/) names.
# These names are also used when using sb-shim, since that needs some

# complete paths like `/usr/bin/efibootmgr` for the executables.

# grub-install --bootloader-id.
#
# If not set here, the value from bootloaderEntryName from branding.desc
# is used, with problematic characters (space and slash) replaced.
#
# The ID is also used as a directory name within the EFI environment,
# and the bootloader is copied from /boot/efi/EFI/<dirname>/ . When

# fallback loader (either bootia32.efi or bootx64.efi depending on
# the system). This may be needed on certain systems (Intel DH87MC
# seems to be the only one). If you set this to false, take care
# to add another module to optionally install the fallback on those
# boards that need it.
