# Run mkinitcpio(8) with the given preset value

# This key defines the kernel to be loaded.
# It can have the following values:
#  - empty or unset, interpreted as "all"
#  - the literal string "$uname" (without quotes, with dollar),
#    which will use the output of `uname -r` to determine the
#    running kernel, and use that.
#  - any other string.
#
# Whatever is set, that string is passed as *preset* argument to the
# `-p` option of *mkinitcpio*. Take care that both "$uname" operates
# in the host system, and might not be correct if the target system is
# updated (to a newer kernel) as part of the installation.
#
# Note that "all" is probably not a good preset to use either.
# kernel: linux312
kernel: %MKINITCPIO_PROFILE%

# Set this to true to turn off mitigations for lax file
# permissions on initramfs (which, in turn, can compromise
# your LUKS encryption keys, CVS-2019-13179).
